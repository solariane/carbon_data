# Cumulative Carbon Emission

I'm NOK with [OWID carbon data](https://github.com/owid/co2-data) since carbon don't stay ad-vitam aeternam in the atmosphere…contrary to what OWID data might led one to believe.
>“About half of the emissions
remained in the atmosphere (240 ± 10 PgC) since 1750” 
[GIEC chap 6](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter06_FINAL.pdf- )

- A rough - and flawed - approximation is to say it last 100 year… and then magically disappear
- A less rough approximation is to say that a given amount of CO2 is back into ocean/biomass/rocks every year
